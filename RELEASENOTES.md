# Notes

* Added support for a settings file so SahasrahBot and the main website can use it easier. (Thanks Synack)
* You'll need to download sprites separately from the official website using the "Update official sprites" button on
 the sprite picker in the GUI 

# Bug Fixes

* Fix for the Windows install package

# Known issue

* Fouton is incorrectly attributed as author to Kan's Big Key sprite.
 With the downloaded sprites, the issue has been forward to the correct website people.
